Project description
In the first course project, your task is to create a web application that has at least five different flaws from the OWASP top ten list (https://www.owasp.org/images/7/72/OWASP_Top_10-2017_%28en%29.pdf.pdf). Starter code for the project is provided on Github at https://github.com/cybersecuritybase/cybersecuritybase-project.

You may do the project without using the starter template (in a language of your own choosing). In that case, however, you must also provide guidelines for installing and running the web application on Windows, Linux and Mac (including guidelines for installing any possible required dependencies).
